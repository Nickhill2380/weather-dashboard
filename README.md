# weather-dashboard

## Description

A weather dashboard that allows the user to search for a city by name. Doing this will display the city name, date, and weather. The weather statistics are temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It allows provides the forecast for the next five days. It allows says the user's searches so they can easily click on a past search to get current data on a past search. The dashboard will inform the user if they don't enter a correct city. 

    In the future, I would like improve the five day forecast to show information based on the next five days at the time of the search. Instead, of the at some point of the day for each of the next five days. I also believe some more dynamic styling that changes based on the weather from the city results would be an interesting touch. I would also like to add a check during the save feature to stop it from saving a duplicate.
